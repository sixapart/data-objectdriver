Revision history for Data::ObjectDriver

0.02  2006.02.21
    - Added Data::ObjectDriver::BaseView, a base class for creating "views"
      across multiple tables, or involving more complex aggregate queries.
    - Added trigger/callback support for common operations. See the
      Data::ObjectDriver documentation for more details.
    - Added GROUP BY support in Data::ObjectDriver::SQL.
    - Data::ObjectDriver::BaseCache->search now uses lookup_multi to do a
      very fast PK lookup, which will hit the cache first before the
      backend DB.
    - Fixed bugs with BLOB columns in SQLite driver.
    - Added connect_options option to Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::DBI, for
      passing in custom options for a DBI->connect call.
    - Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject->remove now works as a class method.
    - Added Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject->primary_key_tuple for retrieving
      the primary key value(s) for an object.
    - Added Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject->refresh to reload an object from
      the database.
    - Added support for HAVING clauses in Data::ObjectDriver::SQL. For views
      that are not attached to a particular datasource, any terms passed in
      to the query will automatically be turned into HAVING clauses.
    - Improved the lookup_multi method for all BaseCache subclasses: we now
      allow the subclass to look up multiple values in the cache and return
      any already-cached items, then make a list of the remaining IDs and
      send them to fallback->lookup_multi.
    - Driver::DBI->lookup_multi will now use an OR clause to look up
      multiple values in one query.
    - Added lots of test cases.
    - Pod fix (Thanks to Koichi Taniguchi)
